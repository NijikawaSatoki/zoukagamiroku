Just an HTML version of an encyclopædia for a project of mine.

### Running

Just run `index.html` using your preferred browser.

※ The only browser tested so far is Firefox. (see note!)

**Note:** I've tested this in Brave Browser and Google Chrome as well. 
The only issue I ran into were font-related, but not beyond what is the usual issues with Chromium-based browsers.

### Editing

If you feel like there is a way to clean up the HTML and CSS whilst preserving the layout, feel free to. 
I'd love to genuinely see it!
