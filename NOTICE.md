What I'm about to do here is a complete rewrite of the entire project.
You can clearly see from the `main/` branch that the current way this encyclopedia is written is.. a mess, to put it lightly.
So, rewriting this entire source code will be my next project.
I will release an archive of the old source, so no worries there.

With love and care to all of you,  
Satoki Nijikawa && Wamo from Niji System <3
